# [Tickbird](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tickbird-co/id1508006830?ls=1): Top 10 and 2nd Best Mobile App @ OmniHacks 2019 
*Empowering visually impaired patients*

An advanced Swift/Node.js mobile app based on the TesseractOCR convolutional neural network framework allowing visually impaired patients to aurally understand their prescriptions or the labels on their pill bottles in order to gain independence and avoid the prospect of lethal miscommunication regarding necessary medicines from their doctors. Moreover, the app's smart profiling feature not only finds the nearest pharmacy containing the user's prescription, but it also uses AI/ML algorithms to detect and set notifications for the times the user has to take or refill their medicine.
